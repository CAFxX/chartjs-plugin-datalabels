![chartjs-plugin-datalabels](assets/banner.png)

Highly customizable [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) plugin that displays labels on data for any type of charts.

Requires [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases) **2.7.0** or later.

> **Important:** this plugin doesn't provide any public API (except the plugin options), thus you should **not** access private properties or methods starting with `$` or `_`, including the `$datalabels` attached property. The implementation can change at any version and could break your production build without notice in upcoming minor/patch releases if any of your code relies on it.
